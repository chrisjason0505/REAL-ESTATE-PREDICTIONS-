# 🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction App

This is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts house prices per unit area based on features like house age, proximity to MRT, and more. The model was trained using **Linear Regression**, and the app was built using **Streamlit**.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Predicts **price per unit area** using user-defined property features.
- Displays **scatter plots** and visual insights from the dataset.
- Trains and evaluates a **Linear Regression model** using `scikit-learn`.
- Shows error metrics like **MAE, MSE, R²** to assess performance.

## 🔍 Research Extension

A companion **Colab notebook** was also developed for a more in-depth, research-oriented analysis — including model diagnostics, feature exploration, and experimentation beyond the web app interface.

---

## 🔧 Tech Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib** for data handling, modeling, and visuals  
- **Streamlit** for frontend UI and deployment

---
